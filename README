DESCRIPTION

Emacs minor mode for quick compilation and running of Java programs.

This is a convenient and light-weight minor mode which allows to
compile and run Java programs without much disruption of work flow. It
is mostly intended to be used with small and medium sized command line
programs.


INSTALLATION

Put javarun.el on your load-path:

(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/javarun")

If you want javarun-mode to be activated automatically whenever
java-mode runs, add it to java-mode-hook:

(add-hook 'java-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (javarun-mode 1))

If the javac and java commands are not on your system path, you will
also have to set the path to the executables:

(setq javarun-java-path "/path/to/java/installation/")


USAGE

Javarun provides the command javarun (bound to C-c C-c), which tries
to compile the Java file you're editing. If compilation succeeds, the
programs output is shown in a popup buffer. Otherwise, the compiler
error messages are shown.

The popup buffer may be closed by pressing 'q' and the former window
configuration will be restored.

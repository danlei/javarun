;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode allows for quick compilation and running of Java
;; programs, making the edit-compile-run cycle a little less annoying.

;;; Code:

This variable only needs to be set, if the java and javac
commands are not on the system path.")

  "The Cygwin root directory path.

This variable is meant be used with Cygwin Emacs in combination
with non-Cygwin Java. It is only relevant, if `system-type' is
set to cygwin.")

With no argument, this command toggles the mode. A non-null
prefix argument turns on the mode; a null prefix argument turns
off the mode.

Javarun is intended to be a useful shortcut when developing small
command-line Java programs. This minor mode provides the command
`javarun', which will compile and run a Java file and show its
results in a popup buffer.
